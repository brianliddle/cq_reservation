Discussion of Campspot Programming Challenge - Campsite Reservation Service

CONTEXT:
Most destination resorts don’t host guests who are willing to stay for only one night. Their
guests are not simply passing through the area; they’ve often travelled far with lots of
luggage specifically to stay there, and it’s not worth it for them to stay one night. As a
result, a reservation system for resorts needs to prevent one night gaps in its reservation
grid, or schedule of inventory. If one-night gaps occur on the grid, they will not be sold,
and this results in lost income for the resort owner. For example, Campspot uses a one-night
gap rule, as this is a common problem for camping resort owners. However, owners’ gap problems
aren’t limited to one-night gaps. Some resorts only host guests who stay a minimum three or
four nights. Those resorts may want to prevent one-, two-, and three-night gaps.

To support this use case, Campspot has a configurable business rule called a “gap rule” that
allows resort owners to define which types of gaps are not allowed.

Your task is to implement the most basic version of a gap rule, which prevents new reservations
on a campsite that will create gaps of a specified size.

RULES:
1.) When creating a reservation we cannot allow a new reservation to be made if there's a conflict with an existing reservation.
2.) When creating a reservation we cannot allow a new reservation to be made if there's an invalid gap between the new
    reservation and existing reservations.
3.) Gaps are defined as whole number of days between two reservations.
4.) A Gaprule defines the number of days between two reservations that are invalid.


ASSUMPTIONS:
1.) Gaps are whole number of days between existing reservations and the reservation we're trying to create.

2.) A campsite is unavailable if there are conflicts with an existing reservation.

3.) A campsite is available only if there are more days than the gapRule between the target reservation
    and existing reservations.

4.) I assume that in general, we would not allow reservations to be manipulated / updated in the past.
    However, the test data is for 2016 so will not place any restrictions when managing reservations
    in the past.

5.) Assume that each data set is representative of one resort.  i.e. No nested complexities of searching
    for campsites across multiple resorts.

6.) Assume that dates are inclusive, meaning 2016-06-07 to 2016-06-10, means the following whole days [07, 08, 09, 10].

 Given this understanding, the following campsites are available between 2016-06-07 and 2016-06-10:
	 Gaprule = 1 -> [1, 3, 6, 8]
	 Gaprule = 2 -> [3, 6, 8]
	 Gaprule = 3 -> [6, 8]

Camp id - names:
	1 - Grizzly Adams Adventure Cabin
    2 - Lewis and Clark Camp Spot
    3 - Jonny Appleseed Log Cabin
    4 - Davey Crockett Camphouse
    5 - Daniel Boone Bungalow
    6 - Teddy Roosevelt Tent Site
    7 - Edmund Hillary Igloo
    8 - Bear Grylls Cozy Cave
    9 - Wyatt Earp Corral

Per the instructions, the following camps are available (although it was not stated which gapRule(s) that they apply against. )
   5 - "Daniel Boone Bungalow"
   6 - "Teddy Roosevelt Tent Site"
   8 - "Bear Grylls Cozy Cave"
   9 - "Wyatt Earp Corral"

Given my understanding of the gap rules, I see the following discrepancies and would like to discuss this further:
 - Campsites 5 and 9 are not available for the dates 2016-06-07 - 2016-06-10 as they have a gap of 1.
 - Campsite 3 meets the criteria for a gaprule of 2 days.
